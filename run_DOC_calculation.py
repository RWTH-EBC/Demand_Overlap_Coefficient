"""Examplary calculation of Demand Overlap Coefficients.

This module demonstrates the calculation of different (single, building energy systems
and network) Demand Overlap Coefficient (DOC) as presented in:

M. Wirtz, L. Kivilip, P. Remmen, D. MÃ¼ller:
Quantifying Demand Balancing in Bidirectional Low Temperature Networks,
Energy and Buildings, 224, 110245, 2020.

DOI: 10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.110245

Example
-------

For an examplary use of different DOCs please look at __main__ of this module, where all
three DOCs are calculated for synthetic time series for one year in hourly resolution.

    This function calculates the DOC for heating and cooling time series. It returns the

      - District DOC                   in Eq. (6)
      - BES DOC for single building    in Eq. (10)

    Input parameters heat_dem and cool_dem need to have the same dimensions.

    ----------
    heat_dem : array_like
        Numpy array with heating demand time series in same resolution as cool_dem.
